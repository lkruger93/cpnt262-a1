# cpnt262-a1
this is the readme for the project by lauren kruger for the course called cpnt 262 for sait!!
my github repo: https://github.com/lkruger93/cpnt262-a1.git
my github pages site: https://lkruger93.github.io/cpnt262-a1/
the codepen i copied: https://codepen.io/joshbader/pen/MZMzjr?editors=0010

for some reason the lego person is not exactly identical although i did use the exact same code thing with the power of copy and paste.  i can attribute pretty much all the code to the codepen because that's what i copied.  the only thing i did not copy was the init() function which was luckily successful!!  i am very glad it was successful and you too can now make your own customizable lego person.
